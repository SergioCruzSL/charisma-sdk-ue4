# Charisma SDK for Unreal Engine 4

This Unreal Engine plugin is verified to work for engine version `4.26` only. If you find the plugin also works in another version, feel free to submit a pull request to update this!

If you have any questions or need a hand, please reach out to us at [hello@charisma.ai](mailto:hello@charisma.ai)!

## Getting started

**Important:** Before setting up the Charisma SDK for UE4, youâ€™ll need to have created a web or game story (not an app story!), which requires a Charisma licence. Please visit the [licencing docs on our website](https://charisma.ai/docs/licencing) for more info!

1. If you havenâ€™t already, go ahead and create an Unreal project! Make sure you are using a version of the engine that is supported by this plugin.

2. Move the contents of this repository to the `/Plugins` folder located at the root of your project. If this folder doesnâ€™t exist, create it!

3. Close the UE4 editor and rebuild the project in Visual Studio.

4. When you next open the editor, verify the plugin loaded correctly by navigating to `Settings -> Plugins` and locating the Charisma plugin. It should look something like this:

5. You can now start using Charisma in UE4! ðŸŽ‰

## Usage (Blueprints)

Weâ€™re working on a new version of the documentation for this plugin. In the meanwhile, to read about the usage of Charisma in UE4 blueprints, [please refer to this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z64Xhe9ij9hpjum1bOzfNEQ8bhwmtHLdiXOlgYsjwFY/edit?usp=sharing).

In order to play Charisma stories from UE4 youâ€™ll need a `StoryId`, and to play the draft (unpublished) version of your story, youâ€™ll also need an `ApiKey`.

These parameters are then passed to the `CreatePlaythroughToken` method to create a new playthrough for each of your players to play the story within!

### Story ID

The `StoryId` is the unique ID of the story that you want to play. To find this, navigate to your story on the Charisma website, and copy the ID number after `/stories` in the URL.

### API key

To create a playthrough that references the draft version of your story, you also need to provide an `ApiKey`. This can be found on the 'Story Overview' page.

**Important:** Please make sure to not share the API key with anyone you do not trust, and strip the API key from any public builds.

### Playing a story

To start playing a Charisma story from within UE4 youâ€™ll first need to generate a playthrough token using `CreatePlaythroughToken`, which has the following parameters.

- `StoryId` (`int32`): The `id` of the story that you want to create a new playthrough for. The story must be published, unless a Charisma.ai user token has been passed and the user matches the owner of the story.
- `Version` (`int32`, optional): The `version` of the story that you want to create a new playthrough for.
  - To play the latest published version, pass `0`.
  - To play a specific, published, version of your story, set the number to that particular version.
  - To play the draft version of a story, pass `-1` and supply an `ApiKey` to the `Charisma` object before calling the `CreatePlaythroughToken` method.
